## About The Project

This project is my ongoing playground for my professional portfolio. From continually updating my skills and my resume to implementing new features and leveling up my web development, I hope you'll give it a glance. I was once a professional dancer and it has been ingrained into my soul and my soles (dance pun) that I must continually improve. Please check me out on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram.
